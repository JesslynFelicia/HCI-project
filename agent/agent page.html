                Vast is one of the best scouts in LaForant due to his ability to find and hunt his enemies. Vast is a master archer who is able to bounce his arrows to scout enemies or kill them around corners. He also has a handy owl drown that can be used to mark where
                an enemy is. With his bow and arrows that can be bounced off walls, he’s able to strike from creative angles that other agents cannot. His skills offer a great amount of versality regardless of whether he’s attacking or defending, so he’s
                a well-rounded agent that can fit into almost any team composition. He can use his ability to track his opponents in combination with his ultimate, which allows him to fire three bursts of lightning through walls.

            <p>
                Narey is a vampire whose abilities are fueled by kills. She can be inflict nearsight on her enemies, heal herself, turn intangible, and even turn invisible. Since two of her abilities require kills to be used (assists do count), she has a very high risk,
                high reward playstyle. If she’s consistently getting or practicing in kills, she can be nearly unstoppable, especially with her ultimate. However, if she’s having a bad game, she can be near useless compared to other agents. What she lacks
                in utility is made up for by her raw killing power. As a result, she’s one of the best duelists and skirmishers in the game.

                Rev wields toxic gases that run off a refillable reserve. She can emit posion from a grenade or create a line wall with the vapors. She uses poisonous gases and chemicals to control and shape the battlefield to her will. She uses a unique fuel system
                that allows her to turn gases off and on as needed. When she has her ultimate, available, she’s one of the best spike planters in the game. Her ultimate basically creates a poison “room”, making her a great bomb planter.

                Zera is the de facto explosives expert of LaForant with some of the most kill potential in the game. She has the most damage abilities of all the LaForant agents, making her an ideal entry fragger. With an arsenal that includes cluster grenades, detonating
                packs, and even an exploding robot on wheels, she excels in sieging on offense and making enemies think twice about approaching on defense. She has a surprising amount of mobility as she can use her (Q) blast pack to jump and maneuver
                around the map. Her kit has everything from a remote detonated grenade and a cluster bomb to a rocket launcher and even an exploding Roomba-like robot.

            <p>
                Tech is the most mobile agent in LaForant, making her an ideal duelists especially when she gets her knife ultimate. She has one of the highest skill ceilings in LaForant because her kit focuses more on mobility than utility. She excels in 1v1 combat,
                skirmishes, and flanking due to her outplay potential. Her high risk, high reward playstyle can allow her to take over a match but she can also be a liability in the hands of an inexperienced player. She doesn’t provide much utility outside
                of a smoke grenade but she can dash to engage/disengage or get up to high position with her boost jump.

                Jeyya is currently the only “healer” in LaForant with a defensively-oriented kit, with a healing orb she can use on herself or an ally. She’s among the best agents in terms of the utility she provides and can easy fit into any team composition. Her resurrection
                ultimate is one of the best in the game, allowing you to turn a 5v5 round into a 6v5. She’s able to use ice abilities to slow and block off her enemies (her ice wall can also be used to boost allies to high ground). She has one of the
                most powerful ultimates in the game with a resurrection.

                Beatrix is a unique agent as an initiator with supportive abilities. she provides incredible utility to her team but she’ll struggle to operate alone since her abilities require her to be defenseless. Flavor-wise, she’s a Druid-like commando that uses
                animal-based trinkets. She’s an initiator + support hybrid that can help her team by engaging, scouting, and healing.

                of gadgets placed around the map with explosive potential. She’s extremely powerful in post-plant situations since she can make retakes difficult and deny defusals from across the map. She provides an incredible amount of information gathering,
                area control, and is the only agent that can disarm her enemies.

                but also himself. With a ton of offensive options, he’s one of the best 1v1 fighters among the LaForant agents. Naturally, he has an ultimate that suits his name as he can activate it, fight and die, and then come back to life where he
                originally activated it.
